Challenge 1 of Lab 3

We modify the macros in trapentry.S to automatically generate a entry
table for trap.c to use.
When using TRAPHANDLER and TRAPHANDLER_NOEC, the macros add a new entry
to our global symbol 'entry_array' in the data segment. We also add
a padding at the end of entry_array to indicate 'end of array'.
Now in trap_init(), we only need to use a for-loop to install all the
handlers.
